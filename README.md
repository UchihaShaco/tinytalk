# Project Overview <br>
The minitalk project is a client-server application that allows two processes to communicate with each other using signals. The objective of the project is to implement a simple and efficient communication protocol that can transmit text messages between the client and the server. <br>

The minitalk project consists of two components: <br>

# Server
The server component of the minitalk project listens for incoming signals from the client and decodes the messages that are transmitted. The server component is implemented as a single process that runs in the background and waits for incoming signals. <br>

When the server receives a signal from the client, it decodes the signal and prints the corresponding character to the standard output. The server component of the minitalk project is responsible for handling the incoming signals and decoding the messages that are transmitted by the client. <br>

# Client <br>
The client component of the minitalk project is responsible for transmitting messages to the server using signals. The client component is implemented as a separate process that runs in the foreground and sends signals to the server. <br>

The client component of the minitalk project converts the text message into a series of signals and transmits the signals to the server using the kill system call. The client component of the minitalk project is responsible for encoding the messages and transmitting them to the server using signals. <br>

# Conclusion <br>
The minitalk project is a challenging and interesting project that requires skills in signal handling, interprocess communication, and system programming. The project provides an excellent opportunity to develop problem-solving skills and to gain experience in implementing a communication protocol using signals. The minitalk project is a valuable learning experience for anyone who is interested in system programming and low-level communication protocols. <br>
